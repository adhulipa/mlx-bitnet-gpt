# mlx-mingpt

This repo contains example code to demonstrate the following:
1. A port of [Karpathy's minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) in MLX.
2. A extension of mlx-mingpt to use `BitLinear` instead of `nn.Linear` to demonstrate training language models using 2-bits as reported in https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764
